dCENTERLAND : A decentralized Offchain storage system. An island of encrypted private folders akin to a shared island of buried treasure. Where the actions of one user do not affect the data of the other users. A virtual island of safety deposit boxes where your passport is the key. Lose your NFT passport lose your island priviledges. With the power of ipfs dCENTERLAND is pleased to announce a one time fee for data storage. Pay once have access "forever".

### Abstract
In the absence of trust opportunities can be lost. A typical solution involves trusting a third party to mediate a transaction across parties for a fee becoming the single point of failure throughout the whole process [1].  Almost every sector in the economy that involves a third party runs the risk of loss to the consumer. A purely offchain peer to peer network may allow for trust free trade trust from one party to another without having to register the transactions on the Blockchain. Multiple signature technology may allow for the network to perform the roles of a decentralized arbiter and notary [4], combined with the ability to issue tokens representative of such funds it may provide a trust free mechanism for trade and investment.

The decenterland offchain IPFS network allows for the identification and distribution of private storage with public key mapping. The DAO contract removes the need for trust. You only need to trust that your data is locked and only you have the key. Your passport (provided) will represent your key. The network will only track the last state of ownership of the passport to correlate with the opening of the treasure chest. Only the last transaction to withdraw your private data from the network will be recorded in the Blockchain to control state. Through multisignature technology the network can act as an autonomous escrow agent for decentralized companies and software. Nodes within the network may choose any token integrated within the network as a payment fee for their storage service. Due to the representation of cryptographic networks as tokens for access to services through decentralized applications. One decenterland DCTR “credits” is required to recieve your dCENTERLAND passport.key to your treasure.chest (folder). 210000 decenterland DCTR have been minted and exchange at 1:1 with algorand or equivalent token

total.supply=210000

10000 DCNTR will be held in the reserve address for developent work, airdrop and decenterland.crypto self storage backup a.k.a "my treasures". Once system is working remaining DCNTR will be added to the DAO contract wallet address where anyone, including me, will need to pay 1 Algorand for a passport. Note, due to cryptographic reality in dCENTERLAND treasure chests can grow, but they cannot shrink. A system of increasing the size of your treasure chest may be implemented at the cost of DCNTR where every doubling of the size of one folder removes the possibilty of a second folder. This scenario is reasonable. 

dCENTERLAND is an offchain data storage island providing anonymity and the ability to store and accumulate value of a single or bunde of private data assets.

I.History
-----------

Bitcoin is Grandpa. Grandpa is all brawn and no brains. Bitcoin introduced the concept of a proof of work ledger. Ethereum is Grandma. Grandma is smarter than Grandpa. Grandma and Grandpa have had many children. Algorand, their first son introduced proof of stake. Zilliqa, their little girl, introduced sharding and speed. As the cryptoverse expands into more and more offspring dCENTERLAND recognizes that this is just the begining. Plagued by 19 email addresses, 17 wallets on 6 blockchains and hundreds of pnumonic phrases and private images created dCENTERLAND as a decentralized storage space on the decentralized web that will hold my data until I need to retrieve it. Using GnuPG and TOMB makes it possible to bury my treasure into a solid cryptographic tomb.

The Bitcoin scripting system relies on a series of inputs and outputs. Each input is in a certain position, has a value and an address, and has a unique identifying txid number. The outputs can be one or many, and they are a list of addresses and values respectively. Lastly, signing is implemented using public and private keys for encryption which provides for an elegant solution to the ”Byzantine General problem” [6].

Multisig technology and contracts create dCENTERLAND as a DAO

As of today there are no decentralized systems in place that can allow for offchain trust free exchange of services without the single point of failure associated with a third party service, users of the service cannot obtain the guarantee that the service provider may not run with the user’s money. It is clear that their is a need for trust free private storage transactions.


II.Architecture
----------------

The dCENTERLAND network will integrate with multiple cryptocurrencies however entry is based on 1 DCNTR = 1 Algorand where 1 decenterland=passport
https://www.arweave.org/technology#papers



III.Protocol
------------------

The network will establish a reputation system, which will depend on server uptime, accuracy, reliability, relevance, identity and trustworthiness. The reputation system will not only depend on the money servers have, but on the quality of service each service provides. The protocol will make use of p2sh accounts extensively. If a transaction is broken or stopped from being completed. The users could take their coins back and attempt to transact again.

Proof of Trust

Nodes cannot be trusted to self-report the amount of funds they possess. The network must be able to audit and prove that the node is solvent. Using a combination that consists of proof of solvency [2], proof of guarantee and proof of trust, the network will be able to prove that every node is solvent. The requirements for proof of trust are not computationally expensive, but they must be dependent on the amount of trust a node can provide. A node’s trust must be composed on its availability, solvency and security. Trusted nodes will be rewarded with fees from incoming and outgoing transactions.

Proposal for guarantee

In order for a Decentral node to provide a guarantee that it won’t run away with a depositor’s money they must deposit their own funds which will be held in escrow by the voting pool, this way should the node lose the funds for any reason the depositor gets reimbursed. The Decentral network requires a proof of funds for each and every node, should a node have less bitcoins than they are supposed to, they will automatically lose their deposit. The amount of money that must go in and out a server must not exceed the deposit at any point in time.



IV.Incentives
--------------

Since the network will be comprised of specialized servers there must be an incentive for users to participate on the network. As more nodes connect to the network the difficulty of earning fees per server will vary depending on the quantity of transactions. A free market ecosystem will be established where the right to a node’s fees are determined by the market, thus we expect the present value of credits, which represent the node’s stream of payments to be calculated following the time value of money principle.

I.Tokens as Credits

Each node is capable of charging a fee on incoming and outgoing transactions, the credits represent access to all streams of payments from a Decentral server. Inherently its value will depend on the amount of payments a node receives. Credits may be traded for the cryptocurrency of choice in order to expand the server’s guarantee increasing the amount of money a server can hold, thus expanding its earning capabilities.

II. Tokens as checks

The token may be traded off chain. Providing cheaper and faster transactions when compared to Blockchain based transactions. The token will allow offline usage in a similar manner to a check. The user could have a local checkbook on his phone. When said user wants to buy something locally he could just send message with the appropriate information. Whether or not the money exists will be up to the merchant to verify no different than when paying at any store, the merchant must make sure that he gets the money and transfer it to a check he owns. In the future, offline transactions may be possible with modification to hardware devices.

III. Alternative uses

A user choosing to create a gambling application could issue a smart contract that was open and properly scrutinized. Anyone could then choose to invest into the application and make the contract only retrievable at the end of the year. This contract could then be tokenized and sold in pieces at any time. 


V.Conclusion 
-------------

We have proposed a system where electronic transactions can happen off chain. Throughout the paper we described and presented the potential an off chain escrow entity can have on cryptocurrencies. Our solution includes a proof of guarantee implemented through a p2sh transaction and a proof of trust. In this paper we have introduces a variety of uses to the network tokens. The universal token or ‘credits’ presented in this paper have all the properties of chaumian cash and the added property for accumulation of wealth throughout time or savings.
